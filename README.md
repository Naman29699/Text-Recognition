# Text-Recognition
This model uses Tesseract to detect text in images word by word. 
The accuracy is prety high in printed text but when it comes to handwritten text in poor lighting conditions along with a lot of noise in the image, the accuracy suffers and the predictions may be wrong sometimes as well.
